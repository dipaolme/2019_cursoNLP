 Presagios de amor (Omens of love)
To love I have lost all that is self my
memories have made
The storm now subsides casting my fate
inside your soul
and these eyes are mine no more to seek
I pour myself in your virgin veins
Now all that I see is through a passions pain
Cause I´m all hung over you
I´m losing myself loving you
Your wine is the blood that drunkens my
heart with omens of love
And now that I´m you woman I fear that
you´re not I
Oh true love is so sublime and so blue
The storm has passed deep inide of me
Crushed by the calm of my insecurity
Cause I´m all hung up over you
I´m losing myself over you
