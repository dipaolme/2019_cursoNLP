 La sorpresa de Jorge (George´s surprise)
Colors turned to magic in song,
and suddenly he found
what he was searchin a way up in the sky,
was right there on the ground
A soft enchanting flower
Had risen from the floor
And as he reached to touch it… amor
So George began a journey to the sky,
the rose began to grow
and what had seemed so simple in the past,
was beauty to behold
a sweet so lovely fragance
slowly drift to the shore
and as he went to breathe it… amor
it was a world of Paradise
appearing right before his eyes
such a George suprise
it belongs to all alive
if we only harmonize
such a George suprise
forever live the colors once they sing inside
the mind, cristal harmony
visions shine on brightly in the night
the music set him free
a fruit of ruby blossoms
grew right beside his door
and as he knelt to taste it… amor
nature knows emotions from beyond,
her sound reveals all
the magic of a moment yet to be,
her seasons always call
A soft enchanting flower
Had risen from the floor
And as he reached to touch it… amor
it was a world of Paradise
appearing right before his eyes
such a George suprise
it belongs to all alive
if we only harmonize
such a George suprise
if we seek realice
take the time to visualize
such a George suprise
