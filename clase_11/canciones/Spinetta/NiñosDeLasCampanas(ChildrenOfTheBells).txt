 Niños de las campanas (Children of the bells)
The children of the bells are dancing
And there´s a preety sound of joy
In every word of love they´re saying
They know that sorrow time is gone
I didn´t think about you
I only come from far yo love you
The chikdren of the bells are lovers
They never lose the magic smile
The rainbow never ends inside me
And the children play with golden toys
How could I dream without you?
How can I find a place where play your bells?
How could I dream without you?
How can I find a place where play your bells?
The children of the bells are hiding
They´re running through my head forever
When life will give me signs, new wanders
The children of the bells will can
I don´t belong to me anymore
My life is always where you want me now
I don´t belong to me anymore
My life is always where you want me now
I didn´t think about you
I only come from far yo love you
Children of the bells
