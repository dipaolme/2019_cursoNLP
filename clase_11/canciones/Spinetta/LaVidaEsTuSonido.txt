 La vida es tu sonido
Life is your sound
Long as the distance
It´s like the tree
Grows with yor heart
Life is beyond
When every little thing is love
Like any mirror
You can see just what you are
Then see what´s true
Life is what you give
Life is your sound
Life is your joy
If you give love
Love, give more love
Nature is love
See the nature through your eyes
Hear every sound
Sing a song with all your heart
Then you will see
Where the magic is
hear every voice
Nature is heaven
So love once, love twice, then love again
My love I love you more now
In love or in pain
Love is the same
So love once, love twice, then love again
In silence… in madness
Love is the same
My love I love you more now
