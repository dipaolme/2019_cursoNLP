 ¿A quién culpar? (Who´s to blame)
There was a time when love
Was shining in your eyes
(with) feelin´s growing
(and) passion flowing
you said our hearts would always
keep that love alive
but now is over, just a memory
who´s to blame
for the dreams that won´t come true
or were never meant to be
who´s to blame
for the joy we never knew
how could we let love… sleep away
do you remember silent
promises we made
they went unspoken
but not unbroken
it´s sad to know that it will
never be the same
we held the magic
right there in our hands
who´to blame
does it matter anymore
let´s say so long and fare thee well
who´s to blame
only winners keep the score
how could we let love… slip away
who´to blame
does it matter anymore
let´s say so long and fare thee well
who´s to blame
only winners keep the score
how could we let love… slip away
No one really cares who´s to blame
