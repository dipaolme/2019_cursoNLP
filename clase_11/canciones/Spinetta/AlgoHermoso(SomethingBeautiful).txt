 Algo hermoso (Something beautiful)
Can´t you see that we´re here for
something beautiful
Can´t you see that we´re here for
something beautiful
Something beautiful
Can´t you see that we´re here for
something beautiful
Let´s go there cause I really want,
something wonderful
That can happen
Look in your soul
Hear your idols deep inside
Hear every drop falling from the air
The rain sings on, anyway
The rain sings on, anyway
We´ve got a lot to learn, but our love is
still the same
We´re gonna get there, if you reach out,
reach out
Please open up your heart
Don´t feel sorrow for me any longer
When we find we hear the flowers
Something beautiful comes to take us
We´ve got a lot to learn, but our love is
still the same
We´re gonna get there, if you reach out,
reach out
Please open up your heart
Don´t feel sorrow for me any longer
When we find we hear the flowers
Something beautiful comes to take us
