 Solo el amor puede sostener (Only love can sustain)
Please don´t fade away -my little honey
Cause you always come around
Please donñt care a thing
Lovely friendly
Things are going to change
Always be within my arms
Little Darling
Since I met you, I would stay
In our common body
Never hurt me because I hear
A sound
Wherever only love can sustain
Love is so far from beyond
Please don´t say a word –little Darling
Things are going to change
Don´t you fade away
I see the valley
And love is just ahead
I´ll never leave you from my arms
Little Darling
Since I need you I will stay
In our common body
Never hurt me because I hear
A sonud
Wherever only love can sustain
Love you´re so far from beyond
